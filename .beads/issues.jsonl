Documentation Updates (AGENTS.md)\nFile: AGENTS.md\n\nAdded new section \"Implementation Task Planning\" (lines 47-93)\n- Documented requirement to use bd commands for all implementation tasks\n- Added examples: bd create, bd start, bd comment, bd close\n- Added examples for syncing: bd sync, git commit, git push\n\n### 3. Testing \u0026 Verification\n- Service restarted successfully on ports 9003 (gRPC) and 8083 (HTTP)\n- Tested with user story grpcurl command\n- Generated 7 test cases in 64.6 seconds\n- No AttributeError - proto field access working correctly\n- Anthropic Claude API integration confirmed working (HTTP 200 OK)\n\n### 4.
